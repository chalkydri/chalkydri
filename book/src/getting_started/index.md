This is a generic guide. You probably want a guide specific to whatever device you're using:

 - **(Recommended)** [Raspberry Pi 3/4/5](./raspberry_pi.md)

If your device isn't listed here, it may work, but there's no guarantee.
You can see our [instructions for building from source]() if we aren't providing binaries for your target architecture.
