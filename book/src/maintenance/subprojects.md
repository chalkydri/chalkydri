
The Chalkydri project has several subprojects, mostly libraries we needed to build it.

# MiniNT

Our NetworkTables client implementation

The existing Rust implementation was overly complex and pulled in too many extra dependencies.
We tried a fork, but ended up just implementing NT4 from scratch.

# TFLedge

Our bindings to TensorFlow Lite and libedgetpu
