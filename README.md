# Chalkydri

A blazingly fast FRC vision solution

---

Chalkydri ~~has~~ will have support for:

 - Arbitrary TFLite models (with first-class support for the Coral Edge TPU!)
 - AprilTags (via a faster, hardware-accelerated algorithm)
 - Custom Python code (for experimentation and advanced users)
 - and more soon probably
