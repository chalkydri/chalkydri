# Chalkydri Manager

Chalkydri manager is our graphical configuration interface, made with Flutter.

It has two "editions", which share code for the most part:
 - **Driver Station (DS):** For managing multiple devices on Linux and Windows
 - **Web:** For managing a single device without installing anything (builtin)
